# Hi there! 👋

Hello, my name is **Akbar Hidayat**.  
I’m a **Software Engineering graduate** with a strong interest in **game development**, especially using **Unity** and gameplay programming.

I enjoy building small game prototypes, experimenting with mechanics, and learning how players interact with systems. My recent work includes Unity-based projects such as a **VR disaster-simulation game** and a **cooperative platformer**, developed through both team-based and personal projects.

Currently, I’m focused on growing as a **Unity Developer / Game Programmer** and actively seeking opportunities to learn and contribute in a professional game development environment.
